Agent Guidelines for DNF-Jules. Project
This document contains a set of rules and guidelines to follow during the development of the DNF-DS Roblox project. These are based on previous interactions and are meant to prevent repeated mistakes.

1. Rojo Configuration (default.project.json)
Filename: The project file must be named default.project.json. Do not use rojo.json.
Ignoring Instances: To prevent Rojo from deleting instances in the Studio (like Terrain), do not use the $ignore property. Instead, use the more compatible "$ignoreUnknownInstances": true property on the relevant node (e.g., Workspace).
Map Generation: Due to unstable Rojo syncing for models, all map elements (Baseplate, walls, interactables, etc.) must be created programmatically. The authoritative script for this is ServerScriptService/MapBuilder.server.lua. Do not use .model.json files for map parts.
2. Versioning
version.md: A version.md file exists in the root directory.
Increment on Submit: For every submission (submit tool call), the version number in this file must be incremented. For example, from 1.0.3 to 1.0.4.
3. Communication
Acknowledge User Input: Always acknowledge user requests and feedback with the message_user tool before proceeding with a new plan. This is especially important when the user is providing feedback or reporting an error.
Testing Instructions: When asking the user to test something, provide clear, step-by-step instructions. Differentiate between client-side and server-side checks (e.g., checking the Client vs. Server logs in the Output window).
4. General Workflow
Verify Changes: After creating or modifying a file, always use a read-only tool like read_file or ls to verify that the change was applied correctly before marking a plan step as complete.
Diagnose Before Acting: When an error is reported, take time to diagnose the root cause. Review logs, check file contents, and consult documentation (google_search) before proposing and implementing a fix.
5. Project Context
Game Manual (game_manual.md): For questions about game rules, mechanics, and objectives, refer to this file first.
Project Roadmap (project_roadmap.md): For questions about the development plan, task sequence, and MVP features, refer to this file first.
6. Strategic Pivots
Directive is King: The user's most recent directive or strategic pivot always supersedes all previous plans and documentation.
Docs First: When a major pivot occurs, the first priority is to update all relevant documentation (game_manual.md, project_roadmap.md, AGENTS.md) to reflect the new strategy. Code implementation must wait until the documentation is aligned.

7. Known System Limitations
Branching: Due to a system restriction, the `submit` tool cannot create new branches. All commits will be added to the existing branch (`bugfix/exit-gate-event`). The `branch_name` parameter is ignored.
